# Dictionary Search Assignment

In this assignment, you will create a simple instance of a dictionary, and we’ll use it to look up information about for-hire vehicle trips in New York City.
There are two stages in this project. In the ﬁrst stage you will code a dictionary in the C programming language, using a binary search tree as the underlying data structure. You will insert records into this dictionary from a ﬁle, and look up records by key. In the second stage, you will code additional functions to retrieve information from this dictionary. You will use a Makefile to direct the compilation of two separate executable programs, one for Stage 1 and one for Stage 2.
In both stages of the assignment, you will report on the number of key comparisons used for search and analyse what would have been expected theoretically. The report should cover each ﬁle used to initialize the dictionary.
